            <h2>I'm a <span class='bold-text'>Web Developer</span></h2>
            <p>My journey as a Web Developer started when I decided to shift my career. I've taken a technical course in Systems Analysis and Development, apart from several courses like Udemy, Scrimba, Udacity, HackerRank, etc... I'm currently looking for an opportunity where I can contribute and keep learning. My main technical stack is HTML5, CSS3, Javascript, Typescript, Angular & React.</p>
