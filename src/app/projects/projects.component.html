            <p>My journey as a programming started when I decided to shift my career. I took a technical course in 
            Systems Analysis and Development, apart from several courses like Udemy, Scrimba, and Udacity. 
            I'm currently looking for an opportunity where I can contribute and keep learning. My main stack is HTML5, CSS3, Javascript, Typescript, 
            Angular & React.

                    <h5>Fácil Tecnologias , Uberaba, Minas Gerais</h5>
                    <p>Fácil Tecnologias LTDA, I got in touch with senior
                    developers, learning best practices, patterns, and
                    how to debate ideas and offer various solutions for
                    the very same problem. It was the start point, a
                    unique opportunity to turn theoretical knowledge
                    into concrete solutions that were being used by
                    hundreds of people every day.</p>
